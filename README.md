Analyze the data to identify potential supply chain disruptions and distribution issues. Output the analysis results in an interactive dashboard using the Folium library.

To create a Python script that monitors potential supply chain disruptions, you can use the following libraries and APIs:
•	For weather data: OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api)
•	For power outage data: OpenEI Utility Outage API (https://developer.openei.org/docs/services/outage-api/)
•	For routing data: OpenRouteService API (https://openrouteservice.org/)
•	For air shipment data: FlightAware API (https://flightaware.com/commercial/flightxml/)
•	For port traffic data: MarineTraffic API (https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais-api-services)
